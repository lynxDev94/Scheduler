Product Requirements Document: Task-Master
Overview
Task-Master is a SaaS web application enabling managers and small business owners to efficiently schedule employee shifts and working hours, visualize weekly/monthly work schedules, and export them as PDF or Excel files for reporting and payroll.
This tool solves the complexity, error-proneness, and inconvenience of manual or spreadsheet-based scheduling. It's ideal for retail, hospitality, small offices, and similar businesses where staff scheduling is vital yet often under-served by costly, bloated solutions.

Problem Statement:
Small teams and managers struggle with inefficient, error-prone, and labor-intensive shift scheduling using spreadsheets or paper.
They need a simple, centralized, digital system that saves time, reduces mistakes, and makes schedules easily shareable.

Target Users:

Business owners or managers (5-100 employees)
Shift/team leads in retail, hospitality, and service industries
HR/support staff managing rosters
Value Proposition:
Provides a streamlined, reliable way to build, manage, and export staff schedules—saving time, increasing accuracy, and improving communication.

Core Features
1. Employee Management
What it does: Add, edit, or remove employees.
Why it's important: Cannot schedule shifts without accurate staff lists.
How it works: Simple form to input name, role, contact info; update or delete employees.
2. Calendar-Based Scheduler
What it does: Visual drag-and-drop interface to assign shifts/hours to employees in a calendar view (weekly, with optional monthly overview).
Why it's important: Central, intuitive assignment of work hours; reduces errors from manual entry.
How it works: Calendar grid with employee rows and daily columns; click to add or drag to adjust shift; quick editing options.
3. Shift Templates (Optional in MVP)
What it does: Save commonly used shifts or schedules as templates.
Why it's important: Reduces repetitive entry for recurring schedules.
How it works: Option to save a week/month as a template and apply to future periods.
4. Export Functionality (PDF/Excel)
What it does: Exports current schedule as standardized PDF or Excel.
Why it's important: Allows easy printing, sharing, and payroll reference.
How it works: Button in UI triggers back-end generation (library-based), file is downloaded to user.
5. Basic Access Control (MVP: Single Organization Only)
What it does: Log in as an organization admin, manage one team.
Why it's important: Security and privacy for schedules.
How it works: Email + password registration and login (no team invites/user roles at MVP).
User Experience
User Personas
Manager Max:
Needs to update weekly rota in minutes, print it for noticeboard, send to employees.
HR Helen:
Handles official schedules, must export for payroll and compliance.
Team Lead Tom:
Sometimes covers for the manager; needs to temp-edit schedules.
Key User Flows
Onboarding/First Use:
Register account → Add business/team info → Add employees → Jump to scheduler.
Schedule Creation:
Open calendar view → Select employee cell → Add shift details (start/end/time note) → Repeat for week → Review summary → Export or save.
Editing Schedules:
Click shift block → Edit or delete → Drag/drop to change.
Exporting:
Click "Export as PDF/Excel" → Download triggers and opens/save as dialog.
UI/UX Considerations
Responsive interface for desktop/tablet.
Calendar view is the homepage/dashboard.
Drag-and-drop or quick modal input for fast shift editing.
Clear “Add”/“Edit” buttons, always visible export button.
Minimal color scheme with clear visual grouping (employee/shift/day).
Loading and success/error feedback on actions.
Consider accessibility for forms and keyboard shortcuts (basic at MVP).
Technical Architecture
System Components
Frontend: React (with Next.js) for robust, SSR-capable UI.
Backend: Node.js + REST API (Express or Next.js API).
Database: PostgreSQL (hosted, e.g., Supabase or Vercel Postgres).
Authentication: Supabase Auth or NextAuth.js for basic email/password.
Exporter: Backend libraries for PDF (e.g., pdf-lib, jsPDF) and Excel (e.g., exceljs).
File Storage (optional for export): Local generation/download from browser or serverless function.
Data Models
Employee

CREATE TABLE employees (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  org_id UUID NOT NULL,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  role TEXT,
  email TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
Shift

CREATE TABLE shifts (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  org_id UUID NOT NULL,
  employee_id UUID NOT NULL,
  date DATE NOT NULL,
  start_time TIME NOT NULL,
  end_time TIME NOT NULL,
  note TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) REFERENCES employees(id)
);
User/Org

CREATE TABLE orgs (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  owner_id UUID NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
(Note: For MVP, user = single admin.)

APIs and Integrations
Employee CRUD: /api/employees (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
Shift CRUD: /api/shifts (GET by week, POST, PUT, DELETE)
Export: /api/export/pdf|excel?period=...
Auth: /api/auth/*
(Post-MVP) Email Notification: Disabled in MVP.
Infrastructure Requirements
Managed PostgreSQL (Supabase or Vercel)
Vercel/Netlify deployment for front-end
Node.js server or edge/serverless functions for export
ENV variables for secrets (database URL, auth keys)
Development Roadmap
Phase 1: Foundation (MVP)
Required Features:

Organization & admin registration/login
Employee management (add, edit, delete)
Shift management (CRUD, calendar view—1 week at a time)
Export current week as PDF or Excel
Responsive and accessible UI
Scope:
Build minimum core flows so any user can create an account, load in employees, schedule 1 week of shifts, and export.

Phase 2: Quality of Life Enhancements
Features:

Month view toggle
Shift templates (save/load common week)
Employee color-coding in calendar
UI polish (animations, keyboard shortcuts)
Better PDF/Excel formatting
Phase 3: Collaboration & Scaling
Features:

Multi-user team roles (add/invite others)
Multiple organizations
Employee access (read-only personal schedule)
Notifications (email, print notices)
Schedule versioning/history
Custom schedules (split shifts, night, etc.)
Phase 4: Analytics and HR Features
Features:

Total hours per employee (week/month)
Overtime and compliance warnings
Downloadable payroll reports
Third-party integrations (Google Calendar, Slack)
Logical Dependency Chain
User Authentication → Required to access/manage anything else
Organization/Employee CRUD → Schedule needs employees/org for context
Shift CRUD and Calendar UI → Core visible feature, unlocked after prior steps
Export Functionality → Once schedules are usable, export is valuable immediately
Templates, Analytics, Multi-User → Builds on stable calendar and export foundation
Build base User/Org/Employee models → Add Calendar UI with in-memory data → Integrate API persistence → Implement export → Polish UI and flow.
Risks and Mitigations
Technical Challenges
Risk: Complex calendar interactions (drag-and-drop, editing)
Mitigation: Use existing open-source calendar/drag libraries (FullCalendar, react-beautiful-dnd), start with basic click/modals.
Risk: Export formatting (PDF, Excel) inconsistencies
Mitigation: Leverage mature libraries (pdf-lib, exceljs); keep PDF/Excel formatting simple at MVP.
Risk: Data model complexity with templates/multi-org
Mitigation: Stick to single-org, single-admin in MVP; design schema flexibly for later scaling.
MVP & Scope
Risk: MVP bloat
Mitigation: Strictly limit user roles (only admin), features (no notifications, no integrations in MVP).
Risk: UX churn on calendar
Mitigation: Launch basic and test with 1-2 user flows before fancy interactions.
Resource Constraints
Risk: Infrastructure/deployment slowdowns
Mitigation: Use cloud PaaS (Vercel, Supabase) for speed, avoid custom servers in MVP.
Appendix
Research Findings
Most small teams currently use paper or Google Sheets—core challenge is “quick edit + print”.
Competing products are either too expensive, too complex, or optimized for larger orgs (feature bloat).

Auth: Supabase auth (email/password or magic link)
Basic App Shell: Sidebar nav, shadcn components, Tailwind layout
Employee CRUD: Table/list + modal forms
Scheduler: Week view calendar; assignments via click/modal (drag/drop if feasible)
Export: “Current week” → Next.js API → pdf-lib/exceljs → download file
Phase 2: Quality & Feature Enhancements
Month view toggle
Employee color tags
Improved export formatting
User profile editing
Tiny analytics (scheduled hours)
Phase 3: Collaboration & Scale
Multiple users/orgs (invite admin/member roles)
Notifications/integrations (email, iCal)
Mobile-specific tweaks
Logical Dependency Chain
Landing Page + User Auth: Public, easy onboarding, leads to locked user area
Org/Employee Models: Can’t schedule without employees
Scheduler: App usable as soon as you can create a 1-week plan
Export: Must build after shift data is ready; adds instant daily value
UI/UX Polish + Color/Month View: Built after main flows are working
Risks and Mitigations
Technical

Drag-and-drop calendar can be tricky Mitigation: Use a simple click/edit form if drag/drop is complex; upgrade later
Export formatting may be inconsistent Mitigation: Use pdf-lib/exceljs “table” outputs; provide a standard, minimal export first
MVP Focus

Too much polish or too many features at start can delay launch Mitigation: Prioritize core—landing, auth, scheduler, export only; enhancements later
Resource

Supabase limits (free plan) for user/auth Mitigation: Monitor usage, upgrade if traction is high
