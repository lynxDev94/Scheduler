# Supabase Setup for Task-Master

## Step 1: Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with your Supabase credentials:

```bash
# .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://hlyokovzyeeapovqdudh.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
```

## Step 2: Database Schema Setup

1. Go to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Go to "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
4. Copy and paste the entire contents of `supabase-schema.sql`
5. Click "Run" to execute the SQL

## Step 3: Verify Setup

After running the SQL, you should see:
- âœ… 3 tables created: `organizations`, `employees`, `schedules`
- âœ… Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- âœ… RLS policies created for data protection
- âœ… Indexes created for performance
- âœ… Triggers created for automatic timestamp updates

## Step 4: Test Connection

The Supabase client is now configured and ready to use. You can test it by:

1. Starting your development server: `npm run dev`
2. The app should connect to Supabase without errors
3. Check the browser console for any connection issues

## Database Structure

### Organizations Table
- Stores business information (name, hours, settings)
- Each user can have multiple organizations
- Protected by RLS (users only see their own)

### Employees Table
- Stores employee information (name, role, rate, availability)
- Linked to organizations
- Soft delete (is_active flag)

### Schedules Table
- Stores shift assignments
- Linked to both organizations and employees
- Supports both weekly patterns and specific dates

## Security Features

- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Users can only access their own data
- **Clerk Integration**: Uses Clerk user IDs for authentication
- **Cascade Deletes**: Deleting an organization removes all related data
- **Soft Deletes**: Employees are marked inactive rather than deleted

## Usage Examples

```typescript
// Create an organization
import { createOrganization } from '@/lib/database'

const org = await createOrganization({
  name: "Joe's Coffee Shop",
  owner_id: "clerk_user_id",
  business_hours: { monday: "6AM-10PM" },
  timezone: "America/New_York"
})

// Add an employee
import { createEmployee } from '@/lib/database'

const employee = await createEmployee({
  organization_id: org.id,
  first_name: "Sarah",
  last_name: "Johnson",
  role: "Barista",
  hourly_rate: 15.50
})

// Create a schedule
import { createSchedule } from '@/lib/database'

const schedule = await createSchedule({
  organization_id: org.id,
  employee_id: employee.id,
  day_of_week: 1, // Monday
  start_time: "09:00",
  end_time: "17:00"
})
```

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Supabase is now configured
2. âœ… Database schema is set up
3. âœ… Security policies are in place
4. ðŸ”„ Ready to build dashboard features
5. ðŸ”„ Ready to implement employee management
6. ðŸ”„ Ready to build scheduling interface

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Environment Variables Not Found**
   - Make sure `.env.local` is in the project root
   - Restart your development server after adding env vars

2. **RLS Policy Errors**
   - Make sure you're authenticated with Clerk
   - Check that the user ID matches the owner_id

3. **Connection Errors**
   - Verify your Supabase URL and keys
   - Check that your project is active in Supabase dashboard
